🚀 Stable Diffusion Text-to-Image with Hugging Face Diffusers
This project demonstrates how to generate AI-powered images from text prompts using the Hugging Face Diffusers library

📦 Requirements
Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed. Install the required packages:
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install transformers diffusers accelerate safetensors
pip install pillow flax jax jaxlib

If you’re on Windows and using CUDA (NVIDIA GPU), also install the appropriate PyTorch with CUDA

⚙️ Installation
Clone or download the repo and install dependencies:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stable-diffusion-demo.git
cd stable-diffusion-demo
pip install -r requirements.txt

Your requirements.txt might include:
torch>=2.0.0
transformers>=4.30.0
diffusers>=0.33.0
accelerate>=1.0.0
safetensors>=0.4.0
flax
jax
jaxlib
Pillow

💻 Usage
1. Import Libraries
2. import torch
from PIL import Image
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline


⚡ Performance Notes
Using GPU (CUDA) is highly recommended for faster generation.
On CPU, inference may take several minutes.
accelerate helps reduce memory usage when loading models.
